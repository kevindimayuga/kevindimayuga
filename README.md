## Fun Facts 🎮

- I am a huge sports fan and love the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Bears. 
- I enjoy playing basketball, volleyball, video games and spending time with loved ones.
- I have dimples, which are also called gelasins and are a rare genetic trait (20-30% of the population have them).
    - I used to be able to hold a dime in my right one, but I can't anymore. 😢
